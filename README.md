# SHED (Sexual Health Education)

Our sexual health education app (SHED) aims to address the numerous challenges facing young
people and adults in Kenya and globally. Sexual health is a crucial aspect of overall health and
well-being, but many people face obstacles such as lack of access to accurate information,
healthcare services, and quality education. By emphasizing excellent health and well-being as
well as quality education, our software can serve to promote good health and quality education
while also equipping users with important life skills.
In Kenya and around the world, young people and adults face substantial sexual health
concerns. These include a lack of timely access to sexual health medical professionals,
inadequate pharmaceutical knowledge, poor sexual hygiene, limited information on where to
seek treatment in the event of a sexual health emergency, and misinformation provided as peer
advice. These issues have resulted in a high number of deaths and other negative outcomes,
particularly among young people. Unintended pregnancies, sexually transmitted illnesses,
unsafe abortions, and HIV/AIDS are just a few of the consequences of a lack of comprehensive
sexual health education. Young people in Kenya and around the world face enormous barriers
to obtaining correct sexual health information, and the majority rely on peers, who frequently
lack proper understanding themselves. This condition is even worse for marginalized groups,
such as those living in poverty, rural locations, or with disabilities.
